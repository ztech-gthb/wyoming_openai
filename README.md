## Overview

This project introduces a [Wyoming](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/wyoming) server that connects to OpenAI-compatible endpoints of your choice. Like a proxy, it enables Wyoming clients such as the [Home Assistant Wyoming Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wyoming/) to use the transcription (Automatic Speech Recognition - ASR) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) capabilities of various OpenAI-compatible projects. By acting as a bridge between the Wyoming protocol and OpenAI, you can consolidate the resource usage on your server and extend the capabilities of Home Assistant. The proxy now provides incremental TTS streaming compatibility by intelligently chunking text at sentence boundaries with [pySBD](https://github.com/nipunsadvilkar/pySBD) for responsive audio delivery. When streaming is enabled, Wyoming OpenAI prefetches up to three OpenAI synthesis requests in parallel while playing the audio sequentially, keeping latency low without breaking event order.

## Featured Models

This project features a variety of examples for using cutting-edge models in both Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) scenarios:

- **`gpt-4o-transcribe`**: OpenAI's latest and most advanced model for highly accurate speech recognition.
- **`gpt-4o-mini-tts`**: A compact and efficient text-to-speech model from OpenAI, perfect for responsive vocalization.
- **`voxtral-mini-latest`**: Mistral AI's multilingual Voxtral ASR, built for long-form audio (32k token context) and tested on up to ~30 minutes per file, available via [Mistral AI](#5-deploying-with-mistral-ai-voxtral) or self-hosted open weights.
- **`kokoro`**: A high-quality, open-source text-to-speech model, available for local deployment via [Speaches](#2-deploying-with-speaches-local-service) and [Kokoro-FastAPI](#4-deploying-with-kokoro-fastapi-and-speaches-local-services).
- **`piper`**: Fast, local neural text-to-speech system with multiple high-quality voices, available for local deployment via [LocalAI](#3-deploying-with-localai-local-service).
- **`whisper`**: The original renowned open-source transcription model from OpenAI, widely used for its accuracy and versatility.
- **`Microsoft Edge TTS`**: High-quality neural voices from Microsoft's free cloud TTS API, no API key required, available via [OpenAI Edge TTS](#6-deploying-with-microsoft-openai-edge-tts).
- **`Chatterbox TTS`**: Self-hosted neural speech synthesis with voice cloning, easily deployable via included Docker Compose. See [Chatterbox TTS deployment guide](#7-deploying-with-chatterbox-tts) for details.
- **`orpheus`**: Canopy Labs' open-source LLM-based TTS built on Llama 3B, trained on 100,000+ hours of English speech with human-like intonation and emotion control via tags like `[cheerful]` or `[whisper]`, available via [Groq](#8-deploying-with-groq) for ultra-fast inference.

## Objectives

1. **Wyoming Server, OpenAI-compatible Client**: Function as an intermediary between the Wyoming protocol and OpenAI's ASR and TTS services.
2. **Service Consolidation**: Allow users of various programs to run inference on a single server without needing separate instances for each service.
Example: Sharing TTS/STT services between [Open WebUI](#open-webui) and [Home Assistant](#usage-in-home-assistant).
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Enable efficient handling of multiple requests by supporting asynchronous processing of audio streams.
4. **Streaming Compatibility**: Bridge Wyoming's streaming TTS protocol with OpenAI-compatible APIs through intelligent sentence boundary chunking powered by [pySBD](https://github.com/nipunsadvilkar/pySBD), enabling responsive incremental audio delivery even when the underlying API doesn't support streaming text input. Concurrent pipelining (default limit of three in-flight requests) keeps playback smooth while ensuring events remain ordered.
5. **Simple Setup with Docker**: Provide a straightforward deployment process using [Docker and Docker Compose](#docker-recommended) for OpenAI and various popular open source projects.

## Terminology

- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**: The process of converting text into audible speech output.
- **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) / STT (Speech-to-Text)**: Technologies that convert spoken language into written text. ASR and STT are often used interchangeably to describe this function.

## Installation (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- Tested with Python 3.12
- Optional: OpenAI API key(s) if using proprietary models

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roryeckel/wyoming-openai.git
   cd wyoming-openai
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install as a Development Package**

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    Assuming you have activated a virtual environment, the wyoming_openai package will be installed into it. This will build and install the package in editable mode, allowing you to make changes to the code without needing to reinstall it each time.

    Or, if you prefer to install it as a regular (production) package:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

    This is more suitable for a global installation.

4. **Configure Environment Variables or Command Line Arguments**

### Note on Symlinks

This repository uses symbolic links to keep AI agent configuration files tool-agnostic:

- `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`
- `.claude/skills` → `.agents/skills`

On **Linux and macOS**, symlinks work out of the box. On **Windows**, git may check out symlinks as plain text files containing the target path instead of actual symlinks. If this happens, the AI agent configuration files will not function correctly.

To enable symlink support on Windows:

1. Enable **Developer Mode** in Windows Settings (Settings → System → For developers)
2. Either clone with symlinks enabled:
   ```bash
   git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/roryeckel/wyoming-openai.git
   ```
   Or, if you've already cloned, enable symlinks and re-checkout:
   ```bash
   git config core.symlinks true
   git checkout -- .
   ```
   > **Warning:** `git checkout -- .` will reset all working tree files — commit or stash any uncommitted changes first.

You can verify symlinks are working by checking that `CLAUDE.md` contains the full project instructions rather than just the text `AGENTS.md`.

## Installation from PyPI [![Publish to PyPI](https://github.com/roryeckel/wyoming-openai/actions/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/roryeckel/wyoming-openai/actions/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml)

Both `STT_EXTRA_BODY` and `TTS_EXTRA_BODY` must be valid JSON objects. The OpenAI client merges these values into the outgoing request body rather than sending a nested `extra_body` field. Supported overlaps still need to match Wyoming's transport expectations: STT continues to require `response_format="json"`, and a boolean `stream` override will update both the request body and the client's response parser. TTS can override raw-audio fields such as `response_format`, `speed`, and `instructions`, but rejects `stream` and `stream_format` because the handler expects audio bytes instead of SSE-style framing.

## Docker (Recommended) [![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/roryeckel/wyoming-openai/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/roryeckel/wyoming-openai/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

  - Provides access to [Orpheus TTS](https://github.com/canopyai/Orpheus-TTS) by Canopy Labs - an open-source LLM-based TTS with human-like intonation
  - Orpheus supports emotion control via inline tags like `[cheerful]` or `[whisper]` embedded in the input text; for Home Assistant, this means prompting your LLM to include these tags in its responses
  - Generous free tier: 2,000 STT requests/day (up to 8 hours of audio) and 100 TTS requests/day
  - Requires Groq API key (sign up at [groq.com](https://groq.com))
  - No local infrastructure required
  - [Learn more about Groq](https://groq.com/)

- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Use the `docker-compose.groq.yml` template which includes configuration for the Wyoming OpenAI proxy connecting to Groq's API endpoints.

- **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file with your Groq API key as `STT_OPENAI_KEY` and/or `TTS_OPENAI_KEY`.

- **Command**:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.groq.yml up -d
  ```

#### 9. Development with Docker

If you are developing the Wyoming OpenAI proxy server and want to build it from source, use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file along with the base configuration.

- **Command**:
  
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
  ```

#### 10. Example: Development with Additional Local Service

For a development setup using the Speaches local service, combine `docker-compose.speaches.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml`. This also works for `docker-compose.kokoro-fastapi.yml`, `docker-compose.localai.yml`, `docker-compose.voxtral.yml`, `docker-compose.openai-edge-tts.yml`, `docker-compose.groq.yml`, and `docker-compose.chatterbox.yml`.

- **Command**:
  
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.speaches.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
  ```

#### 11. Docker Tags

We follow specific tagging conventions for our Docker images. These tags help in identifying the version and branch of the code that a particular Docker image is based on.

- **`latest`**: This tag always points to the latest stable release of the Wyoming OpenAI proxy server. It is recommended for users who want to run the most recent, well-tested version without worrying about specific versions.

- **`main`**: This tag points to the latest commit on the main code branch. It is suitable for users who want to experiment with the most up-to-date features and changes, but may include unstable or experimental code.

- **`major.minor.patch version`**: Specific version tags (e.g., `0.4.3`) correspond to specific stable releases of the Wyoming OpenAI proxy server. These tags are ideal for users who need a consistent, reproducible environment and want to avoid breaking changes introduced in newer versions.

- **`major.minor version`**: Tags that follow the `major.minor` format (e.g., `0.4`) represent a range of patch-level updates within the same minor version series. These tags are useful for users who want to stay updated with bug fixes and minor improvements without upgrading to a new major or minor version.

- **`pr-{number}`**: Pull request tags (e.g., `pr-123`) are automatically created for each pull request to allow testing of proposed changes before they are merged. These tags are automatically cleaned up when the pull request is closed or merged.

#### 12. Pull Request Docker Images

For contributors and maintainers who want to test changes from pull requests before they are merged, we automatically build and push Docker images for each pull request.

**How it works:**
- When a pull request is opened or updated, a Docker image is automatically built and pushed with the tag `pr-{pr_number}`
- Only pull requests from the main repository (not forks) will trigger image builds for security reasons
- When a pull request is closed or merged, the corresponding Docker image is automatically deleted to save storage space

**Using PR images:**
```bash
# Example: Test PR #123
docker run --rm -p 10300:10300 ghcr.io/roryeckel/wyoming_openai:pr-123

# Or with docker-compose, update your docker-compose.yml:
# image: ghcr.io/roryeckel/wyoming_openai:pr-123
```

**For contributors:**
- PR images are built automatically - no action needed
- Images are available within minutes of opening/updating a PR
- Check the Actions tab to see build status
- Images are automatically cleaned up when the PR is closed

### General Deployment Steps

1. **Start Services**: Run the appropriate Docker Compose command based on your deployment option.
2. **Verify Deployment**: Ensure that all services are running by checking the logs with `docker compose logs -f` or accessing the Wyoming OpenAI proxy through its exposed port (e.g., 10300) to ensure it responds as expected.
3. **Configuration Changes**: You can modify environment variables in the `.env` file or directly within your Docker Compose configuration files to adjust settings such as languages, models, and voices without rebuilding containers.

## Usage in Home Assistant

1. Install & set up your Wyoming OpenAI instance using one of the [deployment options](#deployment-options) above.
2. In HA, Go to Settings, Devices & Services, Add Integration, and search for Wyoming Protocol. Add the Wyoming Protocol integration with the URI of your Wyoming OpenAI instance.
3. The hard part is over! Configure your Voice Assistant pipeline to use the STT/TTS services provided by your new Wyoming OpenAI instance.

#### Reloading Configuration Changes in Home Assistant

When you make changes to your configuration such as updating models, voices, or URLs, it's important to reload the Wyoming OpenAI integration in Home Assistant to apply these changes. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Find and select your **Wyoming OpenAI** integration
3. Click on **Reload**

### Sequence Diagrams

#### Home Assistant

Home Assistant uses the Wyoming Protocol integration to communicate with the Wyoming OpenAI proxy server. The proxy server then communicates with the OpenAI API to perform the requested ASR or TTS tasks. The results are then sent back to Home Assistant.
